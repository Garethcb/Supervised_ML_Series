# Supervised_ML_Series
For those who are interested in understanding the intuition and the mathematics that is taking place under the hood behind some of the most popular supervised ML algorithms I have put together a couple of notebooks. In terms of hyper-parameter tuning, these might assist you in understanding the role specific parameters play within each model. Most notebooks contain hand derived examples to better assist in understanding the models intuition and certain concepts.

ML Models:

- Linear Regression (including Singular Value Decomposition)

- Logistic Regression

- Softmax Regression

- Naive Bayes Classifier

- Linear Discriminate Analysis

- SVM Classifier: Support Vector Machine From Scratch 

- Decision Tree

- Random Forest

- Adaboost

- Gradient Boost: Classification, Regression

- XGBoost: Classification, Regression
